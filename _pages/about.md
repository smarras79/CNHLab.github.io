I am an Assistant Professor of Computational Fluid Dynamics at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at NJIT. I joined NJIT after spending two years as a research scientist at Stanford University in the group of [Dr. Jenny Suckale](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jenny-suckale) and two years as a National Research Council fellow of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey in the group of [Prof. Francis X. Giraldo](https://frankgiraldo.wixsite.com/mysite).
I received a M.Sc. in aerospace engineering in from Politecnico di Milano and a Ph.D. in environmental engineering (numerical weather prediction) from [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](www.upc.edu) advised by Dr. [Dr. Mariano Vazquez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fCg0DeMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Oriol Jorba](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kbSmdl0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My main research interests lie in the broad field of computational fluid dynamics. In particular, the numerical simulation of turbulent flows via large eddy simulation of compressible and incompressible flows by means of high order spectral elements. Throughout my scientific career, I spent extended visits at the [Climate Alliance at Caltech](https://clima.caltech.edu/), [Naval Postgraduate School](https://www.nps.edu),
[Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es),
[Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Cambridge University](https://www.newton.ac.uk/), [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu) and [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu)
